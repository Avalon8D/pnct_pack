// implement random fourier features for data_set
// sample im many ways
// i.e. from fourier integral and from other spd kernel transforms
// from sample sums of kernel from a given distribution

// think about devising sampling tree for sampling kernel combinations
// (long term)

// proclus over randomized feature maps
